// Summary : Firstly the code creates the desired canvas for the game and reach our classes here for cleaner look.
//           Then we change the values of each class variable we have to their initial values and added them onto a list.
//           After that, I start the game loop. In the loop I start with drawing the background, the bar behind time bar,
//           time bar, all three of the balls(they will move a bit everytime we enter the loop because the variables
//           are declared outside the loop). Then check for the arrows availability and throw it(also move it the same way
//           but with a smaller loop) and control the collisions all the time, if collision happens split the ball
//           if it's splittable and return arrow. Draw the player and move it the same way and check if any ball hits
//           the player and finish or continue the game accordingly. Finally resart or quit screen.
