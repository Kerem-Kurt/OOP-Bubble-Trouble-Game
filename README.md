Example gameplay: https://youtu.be/cn9Gq35ZnSw 

The game is played with right and left arrow keys, and the spacebar to shoot the arrow.

The arrow will stay still and get longer until it reaches the top side of the screen. If the arrow were to hit a ball, the ball would divide into two smaller balls if the initial ball is big enough. The game is played until no balls are left or no time is left.
